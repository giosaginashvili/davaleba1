<center>   Tbilisi is the capital and largest city of Georgia, lying on the banks<br>
         of the Kura River with a population of around 1.2 million people. Tbilisi was founded <br>
          in the fifth century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberia, and since then has served as the capital of various <br>
           Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and 1917, then part of the Russian Empire,<br>
            Tiflis was the seat of the Caucasus Viceroyalty, governing both the northern and the southern parts of the Caucasus.[8][9]<br>
Because of its location at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the lucrative Silk Road, throughout history,<br>
 Tbilisi has been a point of contention among various global powers.<br>
  To this day, the city's location ensures its position as an important transit route for energy and trade projects. <br>
  Tbilisi's history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of medieval, neoclassical, Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau,<br>
   Stalinist, and Modern structures.<br>
Historically, Tbilisi has been home to people of multiple cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds,<br>
 though its population is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Christian.<br>
 Notable tourist destinations include cathedrals Sameba and Sioni, Freedom Square, Rustaveli Avenue and Agmashenebeli Avenue, medieval Narikala Fortress,<br>
  the pseudo-Moorish Opera Theater, and the Georgian National Museum.</center>

<p class="p5">Telavi</p> 
<div class="d5">Telavi (Georgian: თელავი [tʰeɫavi]) is the main city and administrative center of Georgia's eastern province of Kakheti.
     Its population consists of some 19,751 inhabitants (as of the year 2017).[1] The city is located on the foothills of the Tsiv-Gombori 
     Range at 500–800 m (1,600–2,600 ft) above sea level.<br>
    The first archaeological findings from Telavi date back to the Bronze Age.<br>
     One of the earliest surviving accounts of Telavi is from the 2nd century AD, by Greek geographer Claudius Ptolemaeus, who mentions the name
      Teleda (a reference to Telavi). Telavi began to transform into a fairly important and large political and administrative center in the 8th 
      century. Interesting information on Telavi is provided in the records by an Arab geographer,<br> Al-Muqaddasi of the 10th century,
       who mentions Telavi along with such important cities of that time's Caucasus as Tbilisi, Shamkhor, Ganja, Shemakha and Shirvan.
        Speaking about the population of Telavi, Al-Muqaddasi points out that for the most part it consisted of Christians.<br>
    Ikalto (c. 800)<br>
    From the 10th until the 12th century, Telavi served as<br> the capital of the Kingdom of Kakheti and later Kingdom<br> of Kakhet-Hereti.
     During the Golden Era of the Georgian State (12th–13th centuries), Telavi turned into one of the most important political and economic centers
      of the Georgian State. After the disintegration of the united Georgian Kingdom in the 15th century, the role of Telavi started to decline and
       the city eventually became an ordinary town of trade and crafts. <br>Telavi regained its political importance in the 17th century when it became
        a capital of the kingdom of Kakheti. By 1762, it turned into the second capital (after Tbilisi)
         of the united Eastern Georgian Kingdom of Kartl-Kakheti. <br>The reign of King Erekle II, who was born and died in this city,
          was a special epoch in the history of Telavi. During this period (1744–1798) it grew into a strategic and cultural centre.
           Erakle II established there a theological seminary and founded a theatre. <br>Erekle II's reforms touched upon all aspects of life in the 
           country. They changed fundamentally the political, economical and cultural orientation of Kartli-Kakheti and, subsequently of the whole
            Georgia. His name became a symbol of freedom and national independence of the Georgian people. Erakle II is<br> still called affectionately
             "Patara Kakhi" (Little Kakhetian),<br> and his heroic deeds are described in folk literature.
    Streets of Telavi city<br>
    In 1801, <br>after the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti was annexed by the Russian Empire,<br> Telavi lost its status as a capital.
     In the 19th century,<br> the city was the administrative center of the Telavi uezd within the Tiflis Governorate.<br>
      During that period,<br> the economy of the city was mainly composed of small-scale industries (leather painting, pottery production,<br>
       wine-making, etc.), commerce and agriculture. The town's population was about 12,000<br> in the end of the 19th century 
       (including about 9,000 Armenians and 2,000 ethnic Georgians).[2]</div>

<p class="p6">rustavi</p>
<div class="d6">Rustavi (Georgian: რუსთავი [ɾustʰavi]) is a city in the southeast of Georgia, in the region of Kvemo Kartli and 20 km (12 mi)
     southeast of capital Tbilisi. It has a population of 132,333 (January 2023[4]), making it the fourth most populous city in Georgia.
      Its economy is dominated by the Rustavi Metallurgical Plant.
    Rustavi is one of the ancient towns of Georgia. The history of Rustavi has two phases:
     an early history from ancient times until the city was destroyed in the 13th century and modern history from the Soviet era to the present.
    The foundation of Rustavi is dated from time immemorial. 11th-century Georgian chronicler, Leonti Mroveli in his work "Georgian Chronicles"
     connects the foundation of the city to Kartlos, the eponymous ancestor of Georgians, whose wife had founded a town along the Kura river called
      Bostan-Kalaki (lit. "city of gardens"). The same chronicler, who also worked on 
      “The life of the Kings”, mentions the town Rustavi among those castles, which opposed Alexander the Great's army, although it is
       proved that Alexander had never invaded Iberia. Rustavi is mentioned among such ancient towns as Uplistsikhe, Urbnisi, Mtskheta and 
       Sarkineti. It could be assumed that Rustavi as a city had been founded at least in the 5th–4th centuries B.C. Besides the manuscripts, the 
       excavations of the castle Rustavi prove that Rustavi was an important
        political and administrative center of Iberia. In late 4th century A.D Trdat of Iberia had built a church and a canal in Rustavi.
    During the reign of Vakhtang I of Iberia (5th century) Rustavi took an important part in the political life of the Kingdom of Iberia.
     At the beginning of the 6th century, in 503, the Sassanids conquered Iberia and turned it into an ordinary Persian province ruled by a marzpan
      (governor). However, Byzantine Emperor Heraclius's offensive in 627 and 628 brought final victory over the Persians and ensured Byzantine
       predominance in Georgia, until the invasion of the Arabs. In the struggle against Arab occupation Rustavi belonged to the Principality
        of Kakheti, the latter would form the Kakhetian kingdom, whose ruler Kvirike III the Great, installed an Eristavi (duke) in Rustavi.
         On Kvirike's death, Kakheti was temporarily annexed to the Kingdom of Georgia.[5][6] As soon as the Arabs were defeated, 
         in 1068 Georgia was invaded by the resurgent Turk-Seljuks from Central Asia, under the command of Sultan Alp Arslan. 
         There was a terrible battle between king Bagrat IV of Georgia and the Seljuks, where Bagrat was bitterly defeated and as a result,
          the king of Kakheti gained independence developing closer contact with the Turkish-Seljuks and securing independence in this way.
           After the Seljukid invasions of Georgia, allied forces took Tbilisi and Rustavi and gave it to the Emir of Tbilisi. 
           During that time Rustavi declined, its economy was ruined, and due to its strategic location it only remained as a well-fortified town 
           in the hands of the emirs in Tbilisi. In 1069 Bagrat IV defeated emir Fadlun and captured the fortress of Rustavi,
            Partskhisi, and Agarani. During the anti-Seljuk campaigns led by David IV Rustavi played an essential role in securing Georgia's
             southern boundaries. Rustavi was finally destroyed after Timur's invasion of Georgia.
    Rustavi was rebuilt as a major industrial center during the Soviet era. The development of Rustavi was part of Joseph Stalin's
     accelerated industrialization process, and included ironworks, steelworks, chemical plants and an important railway station on the Tbilisi
     –Baku railroad line. Rustavi is the site of approximately 90 large and medium-sized industrial plants
    Kostava Street, Rustavi
    The core of the city's industrial activity was the Rustavi Metallurgical Plant, constructed in 1941–1950 to process iron ore from nearby
     Azerbaijan. Stalin brought workers from various regions in Georgia, specifically from the poorer rural provinces of Western Georgia.
      Rustavi became a key industrial centre for the Transcaucasus region. The industrial activity expanded to include the manufacture of steel 
      products, cement, chemicals, and synthetic fibers.
    May 1944 was a significant time in the history of modern Rustavi. Geologists began to define
     the soil of the place where the metallurgical works were to be built. The area was nearly empty,
      and there were only temporary lodgings and slums available. Many people arrived at Rustavi, coming from different parts of Georgia.
       The first newspaper came out on 30 August 1944. It was called “Metallurgiisatvis” (meaning "For Metallurgy" in Georgian).
    Rustavi celebrated frequent housewarming parties as many people migrated to the city each day. In 1948 the first streets were
     “baptized” in Rustavi. The first street was named after the Young Communist League, the second, after the builders of Rustavi,
      and the third, after its ancient name Bostan-Kalaki.
    On 19 January 1948, a decree of the Supreme Soviet of Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic declared Rustavi a town 
    of republican importance. On 27 April 1950, the whole town celebrated the production of the first industrial Georgian steel.
     It was founded on the roots of the famous ancestors Khalibs.
    Factories
    German POWs who were captured<br> in World War II were enlisted to build the city of Rustavi.<br>
     Modern Rustavi is divided into two parts—Dzveli Rustavi (Old Rustavi) and Akhali Rustavi (New Rustavi).
      Old Rustavi adheres to <br>Stalinist architectural style while New Rustavi is dominated<br> by a multitude of <br>Soviet-era block apartments.
       The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 proved disastrous<br> for Rustavi, as it also caused the collapse of the <br>integrated Soviet economy 
       of which<br> the city was a key part. Most of its industrial plants were shut down <br>and 65% of the city's population became unemployed,
        with the attendant social problems of high crime and acute poverty that such a situation brings. <br>The population shrank from 160,000 in
         the mid-1990s to 116,000 in 2002<br> as residents moved elsewhere in search of work.</div>

<p class="p7">Gori</p>

<div class="d7">Gori Georgian: გორი  is a city in eastern Georgia, which serves as the regional capital of Shida Kartli and is 
    located at the confluence of two rivers, the Mtkvari and the Liakhvi. Gori is the fifth most populous city in Georgia.
     Its name comes from the Georgian word gora (გორა),<br> meaning "heap", "hill",[1] or "mountain".
    A settlement known here from the Hellenistic period, with the Gori Fortress built at least in 7th century,
     it received town status in the 12th century. Gori was an important military stronghold in the Middle Ages and maintains
      a strategic importance due to its location on the principal highway connecting eastern and western parts of Georgia.
       In the course of its history, Gori has been invaded by the armies of regional powers several times. The city was occupied by Russian
        troops during the 2008 Russo Georgian War.<br>
    Gori is also known as the birthplace of Soviet Leader and politician Joseph Stalin, ballistic missile designer Aleksandr Nadiradze,
     and philosopher Merab Mamardashvili.<br>
    Gori is located 86 kilometres west of Georgia's capital Tbilisi, <br>at the confluence of the rivers Mtkvari and Greater Liakhvi, 
    588 meters (1,929 ft) above sea level. The climate is humid subtropical, <br>transitioning to humid continental climate, with warm
     and moderately humid weather. Summer is usually hot. The average annual <br>temperature is 11.2 °C (52.2 °F), minimal in January
      (0.4 °C or 31.3 °F) and maximal in July and August (22.1 °C or 71.8 °F). The maximum precipitation falls in May 
      (65.8 mm or 2.6 in) and minimum in February <br>(28.2 mm or 1.1 in). Precipitation here averages 507 mm (20.0 in).
    Highest recorded temperature: 38.0 °C (100.4 °F) on 13 August 2006[2]<br>
    Lowest recorded temperature: 22.2 °C (8.0 °F) on 16 December 2004[2]
    Climate data for Gori (1991 2020 normals, extremes 1981-2020)<br>
    Gori Fortress as of 1642, by an Italian missionary, Cristoforo Castelli
    The territory of Gori has been populated <br>since the early Bronze Age. According to medieval Georgian chronicles, the town of Gori was founded
     by King David IV (r. 1089 1125) who settled refugees from Armenia there.<br>[4] However, the fortress of Gori
      (Goris-Tsikhe) appears to have been in use already<br> in the 7th century, and archaeological evidence indicates the
       existence of an urban community in Classical Antiquity. In 1299, Gori was captured by the Alan tribesmen fleeing the Mongol conquest of 
       their original homeland in the North Caucasus. <br>The Georgian king George V recovered the town in 1320, pushing the Alans back over
        the Caucasus mountains.<br>
    Gori Fortress on the hilltop
    With the downfall of the medieval Georgian kingdom,<br> Gori  strategically located at the crossroads of major transit routes  was frequently 
    targeted by foreign invaders, and changed its masters on several occasions.<br> It was first taken and sacked by Uzun Hassan of the Ak Koyunlu 
    in 1477, followed by Tahmasp I of Persia in the mid-16th century. <br>By the end of that century, Gori briefly passed to the Ottomans through the
     1578 90 Ottoman Persian War, and became their major outpost in Georgia until being recovered by the Georgians under Simon I of Kartli after
      heavy fighting in 1599. The town was once again garrisoned by the Persians<br> under Shah Abbas I in 1614. Following successive occupations by
       the Ottomans (1723 35) and Persians (1735 40s),<br> Gori returned to Georgian control under the kings Teimuraz II and Erekle II whose efforts 
       helped to advance economy and culture in the town. Following the Russian annexation <br>of Georgia, Gori was granted the status of a town within
        the Gori Uyezd of the Tiflis Governorate in 1801. <br>It grew in size and population throughout the 19th century. A plan of 1824 shows the town on
         the hill slopes below the citadel, and a moat around it.[5] The town<br> was destroyed in the 1920 earthquake, and almost completely rebuilt in 
         the Soviet period. An important industrial center in Soviet times, Gori suffered from an economic collapse and the outflow of the population
          during the years of a post-Soviet crisis<br> of the 1990s.
    Gori is close to the Georgian Ossetian conflict zone. It is connected <br>to breakaway South Ossetia's capital Tskhinvali via a 
    railroad spur which has been defunct since the early 1990s. Since the 2000s, Georgia has increased the military infrastructure in and around 
    the city. Thus, the Central Military Hospital was relocated from Tbilisi<br> to Gori and re-equipped in October 2006.[6] On January 18, 2008,
     Georgia's second NATO-standard base to accommodate the 1st Infantry Brigade (Georgia) of the Georgian Ground Forces was established at
      Gori.[7] The Georgian Agrarian Science Academy Branch was established in <br>the city in 1995; this became Sukhishvili<br> University in 2003.
    2008 conflict
    Main article: Occupation of Gori<br>
    A damaged apartment building in Gori.<br>
    In the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, the town came under aerial <br>attack by the Russian Air Force from the outset of the conflict. Military
     targets and residential districts of Gori were hit by the airstrikes,<br> resulting in civilian injuries and deaths.[8][9] Human Rights Watch 
     (HRW) claimed that Russian forces had indiscriminately deployed cluster<br> bombs in civilian areas around Gori. According to HRW, on August
      12 Russian forces dropped cluster bombs in the centre of Gori, killing<br> 11 civilians and wounding dozens more.[10] Russian military officials
       deny using cluster munitions in the conflict, calling the HRW <br>assertion "slanderous" and questioning the HRW's objectivity.[11] Numerous
        unexploded "bomblets" have <br>been found by locals and HRW<br> employees.[12]
    By August 11, Georgian military personnel, government, and most <br>residents had fled the city, which was then captured and occupied by 
    the Russian<br> military and South Ossetian separatist militia. HRW<br> accused the militia of unleashing a campaign of looting, <br>arson, kidnapping 
    and other attacks against the remaining civilian population.[13] The Russian<br> and South Ossetian forces withdrew from the city on August 22,
     2008.[14] The following day Units of the Georgian Army returned to<br> Gori. However, Russian checkpoints <br>remained near Gori as well as 
     in so-called<br> buffer zones near <br>the borders with Abkhazia and South Ossetia.[15]</div>

<p class="p8">Poti</p>
<div class="d8">Poti (Georgian: ფოთი [pʰotʰi]; Mingrelian: ფუთი; Laz: ჶაში/Faşi or ფაში/Paşi) is a port city in Georgia, located on the
     eastern Black Sea coast in the region of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti in the west of the country. Built near the site of the ancient Greek
      colony of Phasis and deriving its name from the same, the city has become a major port city and industrial center since the early 20th
       century. It is also home to a main naval base and the headquarters of the Georgian Navy
    The name Poti is linked to Phasis, but the etymology is a matter of a scholarly dispute. "Phasis" (Greek: Φάσις) is first recorded in Hesiod's
     Theogony (c. 700 BC) as a name of the river, not a town. Since Erich Diehl, 1938, first suggested a non-Hellenic origin of the name 
     and asserted that Phasis might have been a derivative of a local hydronym, several explanations have been proposed, linking the name to the
      Proto-Georgian-Zan *Poti, Svan *Pasid, and even to a Semitic word, meaning "a gold river".[2]
    Ancient and medieval history
    Phasis river, 19th century
    The recorded history of Poti and its environments spans over 26 centuries. In Classical antiquity and the early Middle Ages,
     the area was occupied by the Greek polis of Phasis which was established by<br> the colonists from Miletus led by one Themistagoras at the very 
     end of the 7th, and probably at the beginning of the 6th century BC. The famed<br> Greek semi-mythological voyage of Jason and the Argonauts in 
     search of the Golden Fleece would have entered Georgia at this port and traveled<br> up the river to what is today Kutaisi.
    After many years of uncertainty and academic debate, the site of this settlement now <br>seems to be established, thanks to underwater
     archaeology under tough conditions. Apparently, the lake which<br> the well-informed Ancient Greek<br> author Strabo reported as bounding one side
      of Phasis has now engulfed it, or part of it. Yet, a series of questions regarding the towns <br>exact location and identification of its ruins
       remain open due largely to the centuries-long <br>geomorphological processes of the area as the<br> lower reaches of the Rioni<br> are prone to changes
        of course across the wetland. Phasis appears to<br> have been an important center of trade and culture in<br> Colchis throughout the Classical
         period.[3][4] The section along the<br> river Phasis was a vital component of the presumed trade route<br> from India to the Black Sea, attested 
         by Strabo and Pliny.[5]</div>

<p class="p9">sokhumi</p>

<div class="d9">Sukhumi (see also other names below) is a city in a wide bay on the Black Sea's eastern coast. It is both the capital and largest
     city of the Abkhazian Region of Georgia, <br>a partially recognised state that some countries<br>consider a part of Republic of Abkhazia. 
     The city has been controlled by Abkhazia since the Abkhazian war in 1992–93. <br>The city, which has an airport, is a port, major rail
      junction and a holiday resort because of its beaches,<br> sanatoriums, mineral-water spas and semitropical climate. It is also a member 
      of the International Black Sea Club.[2]
    Sukhumi's history can be traced to the<br> 6th century BC, when it was settled by Greeks, who named it Dioscurias. During this time and 
    the subsequent Roman period, much of the city disappeared<br> under the Black Sea. The city was named Tskhumi when it became part of the
     Kingdom of Abkhazia and then the Kingdom of Georgia. Contested by local princes,<br> it became part of the Ottoman Empire in the 1570s, where
      it remained until it was conquered by the Russian <br>Empire in 1810. After a period of conflict during the Russian Civil War, it became part 
      of the independent Georgia, which included Abkhazia,<br> in 1918.[3] In 1921, the Democratic Republic of Georgia was occupied by Soviet Bolshevik
       forces from Russia. Within the Soviet Union, it was <br>regarded as a holiday resort. As the Soviet Union broke<br> up in the early 1990s, the city 
       suffered significant damage during the Abkhaz–Georgian<br> conflict. The present-day population <br>of 60,000 is only half of the population living
